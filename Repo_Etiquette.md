# Repo Etiquette

1. If possible, build a test for every module you write (could be batched in a single script) in pyLDFI/tests/src (see existing tests for formatting examples). Mandatory for methods with non-trivial returns.
2. Make sure simpleLog passes.
3. Do not push until <b>all</b> (relevant) tests pass.
4. Do not push broken code or code which breaks other code.
5. Use code annotations generously.
6. Use newlines generously. Lateral file space is cheap.
7. Use descriptive and appropriate names for vairables.
8. Add comments detailing the inputs and outputs of each function/class.
9. Add comments at the top of each file desribing the purpose of the content.
